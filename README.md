# Gender_Detection-Computer_Vision

Gender Detection is based on the applications of computer vision. There are so many computer vision libraries in Python that can be used for the task of recognizing the gender of a human being. I will use OpenCV and cvlib libraries for the task of Gender Detection with machine learning using Python.

Machine learning can be used to detect the gender of a human using the facial appearance samples of men and women. Facial appearance is one of the common ways that we humans use to recognize the gender of another person. We can also use a personâ€™s voice, but the best approach is to train a model with high-level characteristics of human beings such as:

* distance between eyes, nose and mouth
* measurements of different parts of the faces of both genders.

### Below 2 Libraries are needed:
* pip install opencv-python
* pip install cvlib
